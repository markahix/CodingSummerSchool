This means that any needed variables that aren't given to the function as an argument must be created inside the function.  After the arguments, you need a `:` to indicate that the following code is what should be executed whenever the function is called.  It's also good practice to include the `return` command at the end of the function, even if nothing is sent back to where the function was called.\n",
