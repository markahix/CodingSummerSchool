    "## Debugging\n",
    "\n",
    "It's often said that only a small portion of programming is actually writing the code - the rest is fixing the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Debugging is required at multiple stages of programming, and bugs can arise in many different forms.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Compilation Bugs\n",
    "\n",
    "Compilation errors are usually the easiest to solve, as they're encountered by the compiler itself and are often syntax-related (\"missing semicolon on line 85\") or datatype-related (\"Unable to cast string as int\"), and usually include \"tracebacks\" which can help you figure out where exactly the error is.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Runtime Bugs\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few kinds of runtime errors that can pop up.  They are usually more complicated to unravel, depending on what caused them.  The first kind is something that, while the code will compile fine, the actual execution will return an error.  For example, a function that takes `x` and `y` and returns the result of `x/y` may compile just fine.  But when you run the code, if somehow `y = 0`, the program will crash because of an attempt to divide by zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another bug that can arise is when the results are not what was expected.  For instance, if you have a program that should return the product of two numbers, and instead returns the sum of the two numbers, this is a runtime error, even though no error is actually reported.  The code compiles fine and executes exactly as it is written, but it may not be what was intended.  These types of bugs are why validation and testing are required for programs big and small.\n",
    "\n",
    "Take a look at the code blocks below.  One contains an example of a compilation error, the other a runtime error.\n",
