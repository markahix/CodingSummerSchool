    "# Python Classes - Inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance refers to building a class that is based on a framework of another class.  This can be done when you have need of classes for different subcategories of object that all fall under the same larger category.  This can be thought of in terms of different people having different jobs.  You can have a class, `Person` that has all the usual information about a person such as name and age, and then have a class called `Employee` which inherits from `Person`.  All `Employee`s are also a `Person`, but all `Person`s are not `Employee`s.\n",
