In Python, a function definition begins with the command `def`, followed by the name of the function and then any function *arguments* it will need.  *Arguments* are named variables that will be used inside the function.  This means that any needed variables that aren't given to the function as an argument must be created inside the function.  After the arguments, you need a `:` to indicate that the following code is what should be executed whenever the function is called.  It's also good practice to include the `return` command at the end of the function, even if nothing is sent back to where the function was called.\n",
