    "# Modules - Basics\n",
    "\n",
    "Modules are self-contained larger objects in Python that can be imported and used to make your code easier to manage, easier to read, and easier to modify.\n",
    "If you've used python at all (including the different scripts Dr. Walker has provided at various stages of a project), you've seen and used modules already.  The most easily recognized python modules are `numpy` and `matplotlib`, but there are hundreds more included by default with python, and thousands more available through various channels.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Importing Modules/Libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many ways to import modules into your code. The first example uses the command `import` to load in the module `numpy`\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import numpy\n",
    "```\n",
    "With `numpy` loaded like this, we can use any of the numpy functions and submodules by calling them appropriately.  For example, to use `numpy`'s `linspace` function to get 1000 numbers between 0 and 1, we'd call it like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "data = numpy.linspace(0,1,1000)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "It's also common to see imports assigned to shorter variable names.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This shortened name is the standard convention, and while in this case it saves only three letters, these assignments become cleaner and easier when working in larger and more complex modules like `matplotlib`, which has dozens of its own submodules.  A common shortening we see is this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you had to type `matplotlib.pyplot.plot(data)` every time you wanted to plot your data, it would get tedious *and* introduce the possibility of typos and errors in the code.  \n",
    "\n",
    "You may encounter some well-established conventions if you find yourself searching for various python-related code help on the internet.  The following is a (very not comprehensive) list of some of these conventions.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "import mdanalysis as mda\n",
    "import pytraj as pt\n",
    "import parmed as pmd\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Much of the import convention can be traced to the original documentation for the various modules.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another convention you may run across - especially if you're digging into any of Mark's code repositories on GitHub - is the use of CAPS to indicate module bases.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import numpy as NP\n",
    "import matplotlib.pyplot as PLT\n",
    "import glob as G\n",
    "import subprocess as S\n",
    "```\n",
    "... and so forth.  The specific naming convention you use is up to you, just as long as you don't mix up what you've imported.  Personally, I use the caps solely because they stand out in the rest of my code, making it easier for me to keep track of where I'm pulling module-specific functionality into my own code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Importing FROM Modules/Libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say there's a specific function in a much larger library that you want to use, but you don't need everything else that comes with it.  This is usually because of things like module loading times.  If a module is considerably larger than is reasonable, and it forces your computer to lag when importing it, you can consider a different approach.  In the example below, there's a module called `glob`, which has a function called `glob()` (super helpful/original, I know).  I don't want all of the module, just the function.  So I'll import only the function like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from glob import glob as g\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now I can use the `glob.glob()` function simply by using `g()`, and without having to load all the rest of the module with it.  Another example some of you may have seen is the `gaussian_filter` function from `scipy.ndimage`, which gets used to smooth out rough data into cleaner curves.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from scipy.ndimage import gaussian_filter\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Importing a Module Without a Name\n",
    "\n",
    "While this is not something you should generally do, there are occasions where it might be easier to just import everything from a module without including the actual name assignment.  I'm not a fan of this because it can have unexpected side effects if there are competing functions of the same name in different modules, but I feel it's better to make you aware in the first place.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from subprocess import *\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This imports everything from the `subprocess` module without requiring the use of `subprocess.` before any of the function/submodule calls.\n",
    "Usually this is seen in code examples on the internet.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import subprocess\n",
    "proc = subprocess.Popen(\"ls -lrth\",shell=True,stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.PIPE)\n",
    "```\n",
    "becomes \n",
    "```python\n",
    "from subprocess import *\n",
    "proc = Popen(\"ls -lrth\",shell=True,stdout=PIPE, stderr=PIPE)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Now this may seem shorter and cleaner, but in reality it exposes the user to potential problems.  Consider some other libraries that have a very commonly-named `load()` function in them.  Importing modules in this manner means that the `load()` function will *always* be the last one loaded by your script.  Better to be safe than sorry and not do this.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Importing Files as Modules\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes, we write functions or classes that are consistently useful for us, and rather than have to keep writing them into our code (or risk accidentally changing it in a way that makes it no longer useful), it can be very helpful to just load them from another file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has a default `PATH` that it looks in for modules when importing them.  We can add directories to this path inside a python script and then import files/modules from that directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say we have a file full of functions we wrote called `utilities.py`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import sys\n",
    "sys.path.append(\"path/to/folder/with/file\")\n",
    "import utilities\n",
    "```\n",
    "Now we can use any of the functions we wrote by calling them like `utilities.myfunction()`.  We can also use the same import tricks and shortcuts we've described above, like `import utilities as U` or even `from utilities import *`.\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm sure you can see where this is going...\n"
