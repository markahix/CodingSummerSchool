    "Error handling refers to a set of instructions the program follows if it encounters an error.  If you've gotten any kind of an error in python, you've seen error handling in action.\n",
    "\n",
    "What if you wanted to write code that would just take care of the problem if it encountered an error, rather than crashing and complaining to the user?  If you can anticipate possible errors that may arise, you can account for them and work around them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Error handling in python is based first on the `try/except` commands.  Let's look at the examples below."
