    "# The Numpy Library\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most popular python libraries is `numpy`, which can be found in hundreds of other libraries.  NumPy takes advantage of the speed of C++ and FORTRAN code while being usable inside python, making it extremely powerful.  As their own website states, \"A solution in NumPy is often clear and elegant\".\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll cover some of the basic or common functions below to get started, but keep in mind that there is quite a bit more that numpy can do to make your python-coding life easier.  NumPy has no dependencies outside of python itself.  It also comes standard with most python installations (like Anaconda).  Loading numpy is therefore simple.  The convention is to use the code below."
