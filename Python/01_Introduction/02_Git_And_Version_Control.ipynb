    "## Version Control\n",
    "\n",
    "The most commonly used tool for version control is `git`, with related websites [GitHub](https://www.github.com), [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/), and [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/).  For the purposes of this workshop, we'll focus on using GitHub because it's free and most (if not all) of us already have accounts there.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few steps to do first if you've never used `git` on your current computer before.  These will configure your computer for use with your GitHub account.  If you use multiple computers (including working from a HPC/Supercomputer), these steps will need to be configured for each computer you use.\n",

    "Configure your local machine with an SSH-key.  This will allow your computer to connect to other **trusted** computers that you've previously designated as such, and this includes your Github account.\n",

    "    Enter same passphrase again: \n",

    "You can set a passphrase if you want, but keep in mind you'll be entering it every single time you upload changes of your code to GitHub.  Some people choose not to have a passphrase for this particular aspect of their work, others do.\n",

    "You'll need some text out of a file generated by the `ssh-keygen` step.  If you named the keyfile `git_rsa`, the process will have also produced a file called `git_rsa.pub`, which is the \"public key\" corresponding to your computer's private key.  In simpler terms, the public key is like a \"secret question\" that the other computer can ask, that only your computer with its private \"secret answer\" can properly respond to, so both computers know the other is trusted with this information transfer.  \n",

    "You can configure individual repositories (projects) with these settings, or you can configure `git` globally to set your defaults.  For now, we'll assume that you only have one GitHub account to manage on your computer.\n",

    "touch ~/.gitignore\n",

    "This tells git to ignore anything listed in the file `~/.gitignore` when maintaining version controls.  This is useful for things like cached files produced by various Python scripts, compiled programs/object files from C++, and so forth.  As we continue forward, we'll add some things to the global ignore, and others to repository-specific `.gitignore` files.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay, we we've configured `git` on our computers, now how about actually *using* it?\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say you've made some headway on designing and maybe even coding up some of your project, and you remember how important it is to maintain version controls.  You can initialize the project folder `MyCodingProject` with the following command\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git init MyCodingProject/\n",
    "```\n",
    "This establishes a starting point for all future versions to be compared against.\n",
