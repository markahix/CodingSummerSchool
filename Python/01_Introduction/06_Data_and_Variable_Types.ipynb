    "- `my_int` is an integer, and gets treated like one.  Integers are useful for things like indexes, counters, and so forth.\n",
    "- `my_float` is a float (often called a \"double\" in other programming languages), and are regular numbers including decimals.\n",
    "- `my_list` is a list of values enclosed in square brackets.  Lists are indexed from zero, which means the first item in a list is \"item 0\".  Lists are great ways to keep collections of data organized and in order, and you can extract individual values simply by including the index with the variable name:  `my_list[3]` will return \"pizza\".  You can also get values from the end of a list with negative indices.  my_list`[-1]` will return \"pizza\" because it's the last value.\n",
    "- `my_tuple` is similar to a list, except that it is a little more difficult to pull individual values from it.  Tuples are useful when you need to maintain groups of values together in relation to each other, such as with (x,y,z) coordinates.\n",
    "- `my_string` is a list of characters including letters, numbers, punctuation, whitespace (tabs, spaces, line breaks, etc.).  The contents of a string do not include the quotation marks on either side.  Strings can include quotes using *escapes* like `\\\"` or `\\\\` to include a backslash.\n",
    "\n",
    "Variable manipulation comes in many forms and depends on the type of data contained within.  Better understanding of how data types work can allow you to do some interesting things, like taking a \"slice\" of a string like you would from a list.  \n",
